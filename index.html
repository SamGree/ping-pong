                <hr>
                <p>With smartphones becoming our primary method of communication, people are becoming more and more
                    secluded. Deciding to play table tennis will make you more social, create new, and reinforcing old
                    friendships. It can also bridge the age gap. You will be able to meet and build relationships with
                    people from different age groups and from all walks of life.

                    If you're looking for some kind of physical activity that will make you stronger, more
                    stress-resistant, and more mentally sharp, you should consider table tennis. Not only will
                    practicing this sport do all that, but it will also lift your spirit and make you more social.

                    It connects people from different generations and makes the whole process of becoming fitter much
                    more interesting and enjoyable. If you find gyms boring, this action-packed hobby could be a great
                    replacement. </p>

                <h2>How Playing Ping Pong Can Surprisingly Keep You Alive</h2>
                <p>When thinking about ping pong, also known as table tennis, many people usually get the image of an
                    Olympic sport in their minds. True enough, it is an Olympic sport. But, there is another association
                    some people make when hearing about table tennis — that it’s a fun social sport to play with friends
                    and family.</p>

                <h3>How is Ping Pong Good for the Heart?</h3>
                <p>Ping pong is a fast-paced sport that is also quite an aerobic activity, making it beneficial to the
                    heart. Playing table tennis can raise your heart rate and help to strengthen your body’s
                    cardiovascular system over time.Having high blood pressure makes your heart have to work much harder
                    to pump your blood through your body. As a result, the left ventricle of your heart can thicken,
                    increasing your risk of life-threatening heart problems. Playing table tennis regularly can help to
                    lower your blood pressure, protecting your heart from future damage. </p>

                <h3>What Do You Need to Start Playing Ping Pong?</h3>
                <p>Table tennis is a fantastic sport to get into because it is so easy to start. You’ll need ping pong
                    balls, then some paddles. You don’t need to buy the best ping pong paddles, but you can if you feel
                    like you’ll play the sport enough to justify it. You can also purchase a ping pong table so you can
                    play at home. Alternatively, you can join a sports club or gym that offers table tennis. And that’s
                    it — those are pretty much the most significant things you need to start reaping the benefits!
